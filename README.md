Branch for the 4th episode of universal character controller series. In this episode we are leaving the borders of the player character and starting to interact with outer world. The first think we are getting is a resources system with HP and stamina to waste on our strikes and sprints. Then we'll create the workflow for complex interactions between different entities such as hits, staggers and a parry. As always, trying to uphold those code standards so not a fucking signal emitted in the entire project(a couple are connected, which is okay, they are framework forced).
